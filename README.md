# Introduction

You're introverted. Going outside drains your energy. You are only safe at home!

Of course, you cannot just stay at home all day long. You'll have to get
something to eat at least. So go out, but watch your energy level. Don't let it
drop to zero, or you will lose.

There are two other things you have to take care of: Your bank account balance
and your hunger. Keep both in check to stay happy and energized.

There are many places you can visit in your city. Initially, you're unemployed,
so you will have to get some money from the job center. But of course, going
there is not a pleasant experience, so your energy will deplete very quickly.

If you stumble upon a Yoshi egg, try bringing it back to your place. Maybe you
can get some energy from it?

All over the city, surprises are waiting for you. So go out, explore, get out of
your comfort zone! But remember, your home will always be there.
